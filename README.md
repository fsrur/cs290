# exercise
MERN stack web application designed to manage a list of physical exercises. Using the React library on the frontend, users interact with an intuitive interface to perform CRUD operations on the exercise list. React hooks such as useState and useEffect manage state and side effects, while React Router handles navigation between pages. <br />
On the server side, Express in conjunction with Node provides a RESTful API, connecting to a MongoDB database through the Mongoose.
